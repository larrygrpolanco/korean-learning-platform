This setup provides a clean, intuitive structure where:

Each page maintains consistent navigation with breadcrumbs so users always know where they are.
The module page shows an overview of available units with their sections.
The unit page displays the actual learning content with audio and images.

To add new content, you would:

Add your audio files to the static/audio/[course]/[module]/[unit]/ directory
Add your images to the static/images/[course]/[module]/[unit]/ directory
Update the content structure in your data files

The setup uses minimal styling while maintaining a professional appearance. All the Tailwind classes are straightforward and focused on layout and spacing.


To add new content, you would:

Create a new unit folder in your module directory
Add your content.json file with this structure
Add your media files to the corresponding folders in static
Update the parent module.json to include the new unit in its units array
