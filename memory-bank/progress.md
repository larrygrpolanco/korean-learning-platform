# Progress - Korean Language Learning Webapp

## Current Status: Foundation Phase

### Project Initialization ✅ COMPLETE

### Memory Bank Documentation ✅ COMPLETE

## What Works

### Established Foundation
- **Clear Architecture**: Modular lesson structure with self-contained packages
- **Technology Stack**: SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS provides solid foundation
- **Documentation System**: Memory bank ensures continuity across development sessions
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design principles prioritize touch interactions

### Proven Patterns
- **JSON Content Strategy**: Flexible structure for vocabulary and lesson data
- **Server-Side API Design**: Secure pattern for future AI integration
- **Component Hierarchy**: Clear separation between UI, lesson, and layout components
- **File Organization**: Logical structure that supports experimentation

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Structure ✅ COMPLETE

### Phase 2: Homepage Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### Phase 3: First Lesson - Market Ordering ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Lesson Package Structure**: Create `/src/routes/lessons/market-ordering/`
- [x] **Content Files**:
  - `lesson.json` - Lesson metadata with 3 phases and cultural context
  - `vocabulary.json` - Korean vocabulary with pronunciations and examples
- [x] **Lesson Components**:
  - `+page.svelte` - Main lesson interface with Svelte 5 state management
  - `+page.server.js` - Server-side data loading with future API placeholders
- [x] **Game Mechanics**:
  - Color vocabulary practice (파란색, 빨간색, 초록색, 노란색)
  - Fish name practice (연어, 참치, 광어, 고등어)
  - Multiple choice interactions with immediate feedback
  - Progress tracking within lesson with visual progress bar
  - Auto-advancement between questions and phases
  - Lesson completion with score display

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing 
- **Market Ordering Game**: Needs a lot of work, very basic right now.

## Current Status Details

### Recently Completed
1. **Memory Bank Creation** (2025-01-29)
   - Established comprehensive documentation system
   - Documented all architectural decisions and patterns
   - Created clear roadmap for implementation

2. **Project Analysis** (2025-01-29)
   - Examined existing SvelteKit setup
   - Confirmed Tailwind CSS 4.0 configuration
   - Identified starting point for development

### Active Work
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed breakdown of development phases
- **Component Design**: Planning shared component architecture
- **Content Strategy**: Defining Korean vocabulary and lesson structure

### Next Milestone
**Target**: Improve on Market Lesson

## Known Issues

### Technical Considerations
- **Audio Integration**: Need to plan for Korean pronunciation audio files
- **Mobile Performance**: Must test touch responsiveness on actual devices
- **Content Management**: JSON file organization as lessons scale
- **AI Integration**: Server-side API key management and error handling

### Design Challenges
- **Korean Typography**: Ensure proper Korean font rendering
- **Cultural Context**: Authentic Korean social scenarios in lessons
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Smooth learning curve within lessons
- **Engagement**: Maintaining user interest through simple interactions

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Assumptions
- Started with basic SvelteKit project structure
- Planned for simple text-based interactions
- Focused on single lesson implementation

### Refined Understanding
- **Modularity is Critical**: Each lesson must be completely independent
- **Mobile-First is Essential**: Korean learners primarily use mobile devices
- **Documentation Drives Success**: Memory bank system prevents knowledge loss
- **Simple Beats Complex**: Start with basic interactions, add sophistication later

### Key Insights Gained
1. **Server Routes for AI**: SvelteKit server routes perfect for API integration
2. **JSON Content Strategy**: Flexible enough for experimentation, structured enough for consistency
3. **Component Isolation**: Shared components only when 3+ lessons need them
4. **Cultural Authenticity**: Korean social context must be embedded naturally

## Risk Mitigation Status

### Identified Risks
1. **Mobile Performance**: Audio playback and touch responsiveness
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement, fallback options
2. **Content Scalability**: JSON file management as lessons grow
   - *Mitigation*: Clear naming conventions, modular structure
3. **AI Integration Complexity**: Server-side API management
   - *Mitigation*: Start with placeholders, add functionality gradually

### Monitoring Plan
- Regular mobile device testing during development
- Performance monitoring with each new component
- Documentation updates with each significant change

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 5: AI Integration (Future)
- OpenRouter LLM integration for personalized feedback
- OpenAI TTS for Korean pronunciation
- Speech-to-text for pronunciation practice
- AI image generation for visual feedback

### Phase 6: Content Expansion (Future)
- Restaurant ordering lesson
- Shopping scenarios
- Direction asking/giving
- Phone conversation practice

### Phase 7: Advanced Features (Future)
- User progress tracking (SQLite integration)
- Difficulty adaptation
- Spaced repetition system
- Social features and sharing

## Documentation Maintenance

### Update Triggers
- **Major Architecture Changes**: Update systemPatterns.md
- **New Technology Integration**: Update techContext.md
- **User Experience Changes**: Update productContext.md
- **Current Work Shifts**: Update activeContext.md
- **Milestone Completion**: Update progress.md

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review activeContext.md for current focus
- **Milestone**: Update progress.md with completed work
- **Major Changes**: Review all memory bank files for consistency
- **Session End**: Document current state and next steps
