- **Server-Side API Design**: Secure pattern for future AI integration
- **Component Hierarchy**: Clear separation between UI, lesson, and layout components
- **File Organization**: Logical structure that supports experimentation

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Structure ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **API Route Structure**: Create placeholder endpoints for future AI integration
  - `/src/routes/api/openrouter/+server.js`
  - `/src/routes/api/speech/tts/+server.js`
  - `/src/routes/api/speech/stt/+server.js`
  - `/src/routes/api/images/generate/+server.js`

- [x] **Shared Components**: Basic UI building blocks
  - `Button.svelte` - Primary/secondary button styles with Svelte 5 runes
  - `Card.svelte` - Content container component with accessibility fixes
  - `Progress.svelte` - Progress indicator with percentage display
  - `LessonCard.svelte` - Homepage lesson preview with difficulty badges

- [x] **Component Directory Structure**:
  - `/src/lib/components/ui/` - Basic UI elements
  - `/src/lib/components/lesson/` - Lesson-specific components
  - `/src/lib/components/layout/` - Layout components (ready for expansion)

### Phase 2: Homepage Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Homepage Redesign**: Replace default SvelteKit welcome page
- [x] **Lesson Grid Layout**: Mobile-responsive lesson navigation with 3-column grid
- [x] **Lesson Preview Cards**: Show lesson title, description, difficulty, time, tags
- [x] **Navigation System**: Clear paths to individual lessons with "Start Lesson" buttons

### Phase 3: First Lesson - Market Ordering ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Lesson Package Structure**: Create `/src/routes/lessons/market-ordering/`
- [x] **Content Files**:
  - `lesson.json` - Lesson metadata with 3 phases and cultural context
  - `vocabulary.json` - Korean vocabulary with pronunciations and examples
- [x] **Lesson Components**:
  - `+page.svelte` - Main lesson interface with Svelte 5 state management
  - `+page.server.js` - Server-side data loading with future API placeholders
- [x] **Game Mechanics**:
  - Color vocabulary practice (파란색, 빨간색, 초록색, 노란색)
  - Fish name practice (연어, 참치, 광어, 고등어)
  - Multiple choice interactions with immediate feedback
  - Progress tracking within lesson with visual progress bar
  - Auto-advancement between questions and phases
  - Lesson completion with score display

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tested on mobile viewport, works perfectly
- [x] **Touch Interactions**: 44px minimum touch targets implemented
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Fast loading with Vite HMR
- [x] **Accessibility**: Fixed button nesting issues, proper ARIA labels

## Current Status Details

### Recently Completed
1. **Memory Bank Creation** (2025-01-29)
   - Established comprehensive documentation system
   - Documented all architectural decisions and patterns
   - Created clear roadmap for implementation

2. **Project Analysis** (2025-01-29)
   - Examined existing SvelteKit setup
   - Confirmed Tailwind CSS 4.0 configuration
   - Identified starting point for development

### Active Work
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed breakdown of development phases
- **Component Design**: Planning shared component architecture
- **Content Strategy**: Defining Korean vocabulary and lesson structure

### Next Milestone
**Target**: Complete Phase 1 (Core Structure) by end of current session
- Create API route placeholders
- Build shared UI components
- Set up lesson directory structure

## Known Issues

### Technical Considerations
- **Audio Integration**: Need to plan for Korean pronunciation audio files
- **Mobile Performance**: Must test touch responsiveness on actual devices
- **Content Management**: JSON file organization as lessons scale
- **AI Integration**: Server-side API key management and error handling

### Design Challenges
- **Korean Typography**: Ensure proper Korean font rendering
- **Cultural Context**: Authentic Korean social scenarios in lessons
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Smooth learning curve within lessons
- **Engagement**: Maintaining user interest through simple interactions

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Assumptions
- Started with basic SvelteKit project structure
- Planned for simple text-based interactions
- Focused on single lesson implementation

### Refined Understanding
- **Modularity is Critical**: Each lesson must be completely independent
- **Mobile-First is Essential**: Korean learners primarily use mobile devices
- **Documentation Drives Success**: Memory bank system prevents knowledge loss
- **Simple Beats Complex**: Start with basic interactions, add sophistication later

### Key Insights Gained
1. **Server Routes for AI**: SvelteKit server routes perfect for API integration
2. **JSON Content Strategy**: Flexible enough for experimentation, structured enough for consistency
3. **Component Isolation**: Shared components only when 3+ lessons need them
4. **Cultural Authenticity**: Korean social context must be embedded naturally

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All API route placeholders created and accessible
- [ ] Shared components render correctly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Component directory structure follows established patterns
- [ ] Code quality meets formatting and linting standards

### Overall Project Success
- **User Experience**: Users can complete Market Ordering lesson in 10-15 minutes
- **Technical Performance**: < 2 second load time on 3G mobile connection
- **Code Quality**: New lessons can be created following established patterns
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Users feel confident using learned vocabulary

## Risk Mitigation Status

### Identified Risks
1. **Mobile Performance**: Audio playback and touch responsiveness
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement, fallback options
2. **Content Scalability**: JSON file management as lessons grow
   - *Mitigation*: Clear naming conventions, modular structure
3. **AI Integration Complexity**: Server-side API management
   - *Mitigation*: Start with placeholders, add functionality gradually

### Monitoring Plan
- Regular mobile device testing during development
- Performance monitoring with each new component
- Documentation updates with each significant change

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 5: AI Integration (Future)
- OpenRouter LLM integration for personalized feedback
- OpenAI TTS for Korean pronunciation
- Speech-to-text for pronunciation practice
- AI image generation for visual feedback
